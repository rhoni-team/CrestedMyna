                    The eBird data for the Crested Myna was filtered and tidied using the AUK package in R. 
                    The code used for this process is available in our repository 
                    <a href="https://github.com/rhoni-team/Crested_Myna_Data_Analysis" target="_blank">
                        <em>Crested Myna Data Analysis</em></a>.
                        Once the data was preprocessed, it was further analyzed to understand the distribution of 
                        the species across different countries. This involved spatially joining eBird observations
                        with country polygons to calculate the number of bird observations in each 
                        country over time. Additionally, each country with Crested Myna sightings was 
                        categorized as either part of the species' native range or outside of it, 
                        according information from <a href="#bibliography">bibliography</a>.

                    The country polygon layer was initially processed with PostGIS to ensure all geometries were

                        valid</a>. After validation, the polygons were simplified to reduce geometric complexity,
                        optimizing the data for spatial analysis without sacrificing significant detail.
                        The SQL code can be found in our repository, in the django migrations applied over the database.
